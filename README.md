# tv-script-generator

This work was done for Udacity's deep learning nanodegree as a project work for RNNs.

This deep learning model utilizes LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) machine learning architecture to generate text.
The model was trained with Seinfield TV series transcripts and as an outcome the model tries to generate new TV scripts.
While the model itself does not reach human level of transscripting, it showcases how the RNN (LSTM) can work in a text based generation work.

The notebook is quite exhaustive in explaining each parts, so please see more details in the notebook.
